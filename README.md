# ACM Sentiment Score

## Langauge

My code is completed in Swift. It may not run completely. I am using the sentimentScore theme that is bundled with Swift.

## Explanation
I researched into how how swift runs alongside the sentimentScore theme, it is declared in line 20. The theme does a majority of the calculations to determine the score! Most of my explanations are in the actual code.
